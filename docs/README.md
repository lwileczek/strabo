# Documentation
Here we begin our journy to define exactly what we want built, and how to use it.

## Specification & Syntax
Details on the syntax and examples can be found within [syntax](./syntax).

The goal is to describe our REST endpoints in a way that is similar to how it is
defined in our code.
We define data structures (struct/types/interfaces) and then we create routers with
endpoints that request specific data and return data.
