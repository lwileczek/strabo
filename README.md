# Strabo
A simple syntax to define REST endpoints similar to how we define our endpoints in our code.

Using simple data structures we can define what we expect to receive and return.
This is a biased and simplistic way to define simple endpoints.

## Getting Started
Please review the examples and syntax within the [documentation](./docs) directory.

## Status
Alpha

## Roadmap
 - [ ] templating. Render data into HTML files
 - interpreter. Read custom data file which defines the endpoints 
     - [ ] lexer
     - [ ] parser
