# Strabo
Create HTML pages which document APIs based on simple data files
similar to Cue.

## Why?
OpenAPI is too verbose for my taste, and also doesn't directly allow me to add the documentation
directly to my site.

## Status
Alpha

## Roadmap
 - [ ] templating. Render data into HTML files
 - interpreter. Read custom data file which defines the endpoints 
     - [ ] lexer
     - [ ] parser
